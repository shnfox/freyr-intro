            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My name is Jason Fox. I am 45 years old and am starting a new career as a computer coder after bar and
                restraunt
                managemnet for almost 20 years. I initially learned to code throught the Last Mile program whiel I was
                incarcerated in Michigan. I fell in love with coding and the possible things that I can do with it. This
                is an exciting time for me and also very scary because anything new
                is
                scary,
                right? I can't wait to learn as much as I can about as many languages as I can as well.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I have started an app that keeps track of my record collection. This app helps me have my entire
                collection
                at my
                fingertips instead of leafing through a pill of paper to find what I'm looking for. This app has a long
                way to go but at least there is a framework there that is workable.</p>
