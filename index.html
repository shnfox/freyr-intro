Jason Fox
<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Jason Fox. I am 45 years old and am starting a new career as a computer coder after bar and restraunt
    managemnet for the past 20 years. This is an exciting time for me and also very scary because anything new is scary,
    right? I can't wait to learn as much as I can about as many languages as I can as well.</p>

<h1>Experience</h1>
<p>I have started an app that keeps track of my record collection. This app helps me have my entire collection at my
    fingertips instead of leafing through a pill of paper to find what I'm looking for.</p>
